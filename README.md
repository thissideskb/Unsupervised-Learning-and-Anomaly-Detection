# Unsupervised-Learning-and-Anomaly-Detection
# 🧠 Unsupervised Learning & Anomaly Detection – Mini Project

This project covers the key concepts of **Dimensionality Reduction**, **Clustering**,  
**Anomaly Detection**, and **Time Series Analysis**.  
It was originally an academic assignment, but I have presented it here like a clean ML mini-project.
